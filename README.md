Tower-Defense
=============

This repository features a tower defense engine and a very simple game built on top of that. 
This was a project for my design patterns course in my Sophomore year at Shippensburg University.
All design patterns were implemented without the use of Java's built in classes due to the nature of
the course. There is an A* implementation which is probably the highlight of this now.
